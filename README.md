# Index-Project
This is a repository for the programs needed to run the index project. 
Code in this project is a compilation of the different requirements for launching an index protocol.
Updates and new inclusions will target growing use cases for the protocol. They will be submitted into a branch before being pulled to the main. 
Note: some of the projects require associative shelf files. Make sure to import those before running the main code.
